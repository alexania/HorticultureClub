## 🌿 Durban Horticulture Club: Concept & Vibe

**Theme:**  
Victorian Dark Academia meets Plant Illuminati meets botanical mischief. Think:  
- Sepia-toned illustrations of ferns and fungi  
- Wax-sealed club letters  
- Latin plant names in ornate serif fonts  
- A touch of mystery, like your club might also dabble in cryptobotany

**Tone:**  
Playful, erudite, slightly conspiratorial. You’re not just gardeners—you’re *keepers of the greenbelt arcana*.
