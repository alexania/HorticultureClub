As the veil of winter lifts, the first week of September marks the official beginning of spring in the Society’s calendar. The soil breathes again, mosses awaken, and the fern ancestors stir beneath the mulch. The New Moon offers potent energy for planting, propagation, and quiet ritual work.

## Sacred Garden Duties

As the soil stirs and the fungal networks reawaken, members are called to enact the rites of renewal. Below are the recommended tasks for this week, drawn from both horticultural wisdom and the Society’s seasonal traditions:

### 🌸 Orchids (Indigenous & Tropical)

- **Repot if needed**: Spring is ideal for repotting orchids that have outgrown their vessels. Use fresh bark mix and offer a misted blessing.
- **Increase watering**: Resume regular watering as temperatures rise, but avoid waterlogging. Mist daily if humidity drops below 60%.
- **Feed lightly**: Apply a diluted orchid fertilizer to support new root and bud growth.
- **Inspect for pests**: Look for mealybugs and scale—remove with a cotton swab dipped in spirit and recite the *Rite of Purification*.

### 🥬 Vegetables (Warm-Season Crops)

- **Sow directly**: Beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, and sweetcorn can be sown now. Mark rows with ceremonial twigs.
- **Prepare beds**: Enrich soil with compost and aged manure. Turn gently with a three-pronged fork while whispering intentions.
- **Mulch lightly**: Use straw or leaf litter to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
- **Start seedlings**: Begin capsicum, brinjal, and basil in trays under filtered light.

### 🌹 Roses (Established Shrubs)

- **Prune with purpose**: Remove dead wood and shape for airflow. Each cut should be made with reverence and a clean blade.
- **Feed generously**: Apply a balanced rose fertilizer and water deeply.
- **Mulch with compost**: Surround the base with organic mulch to awaken root systems.
- **Inspect for black spot**: Treat early with neem oil and a protective incantation.

### 🍊 Fruit Trees (Citrus, Fig, Guava)

- **Thin blossoms**: On young trees, remove excess flowers to direct energy into fewer, stronger fruits.
- **Feed with nitrogen**: Apply a slow-release fertilizer to support spring flush.
- **Check irrigation**: Ensure deep watering reaches root zones. Adjust emitters if using drip systems.
- **Inspect bark and branches**: Look for scale insects and fungal growth. Treat with horticultural oil and a bark blessing.

## 🌫️ Rituals of the Week

### 🌑 New Moon Propagation Ceremony
Performed at dawn in the Secret Garden. Members gathered to plant intentions alongside bulbs, invoking *Custodes Arcana Viridis* to bless the soil.

### 🧴 Terrarium Blessing
Each moss-filled vessel was misted in a figure-eight pattern while reciting the Society’s seasonal invocation. A drop of rainwater and a pinch of sacred soil were added to seal the ritual.

### 🎆 Naming of the Verdant Hollow
A moss-rich alcove discovered during the Derivco expedition was formally named and consecrated. A wax-sealed scroll was buried beneath a cairn to mark the site.

## 🧭 Atmospheric Interpretation

Humidity levels remain ideal for transplanting and terrarium work. The air carries a subtle charge—interpreted by the Society’s barometric diviners as a sign of fungal network reactivation. Expect increased bird activity and spontaneous seed germination.

## 🌿 Featured Plant Wisdom

### *Scadoxus multiflorus* — African Blood Lily  
A fiery herald of spring, this bulbous plant blooms with spherical red inflorescences that resemble botanical lanterns.  
**Mystical Properties:**  
- Symbol of renewal and bold intention  
- Said to glow faintly under moonlight when properly blessed  
- Used in the Society’s Equinox rites
