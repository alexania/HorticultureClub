## Sacred Garden Duties

### 🌱 Seeds of Awakening

The earth calls for these seeds to be planted directly into blessed soil:

- **Beans** - Runner beans, climbing beans, dwarf French beans
- **Sweetcorn** - Plant in blocks for mystical cross-pollination  
- **Cucumbers** - Bush varieties for containers, climbing types for trellises
- **Squash** - Butternut, gem squash, and pumpkins for autumn harvest
- **Herbs** - Basil, coriander, dill, rocket - sow in succession for continuous harvest

### 🪴 Transplantation Rites

Seedlings ready for sacred ground:

- **Tomatoes** - Transplant hardened seedlings to prepared beds with deep watering rituals
- **Capsicums** - Move from propagation chambers to warm, sheltered positions
- **Brinjals** - Plant out when soil temperature reaches 18°C consistently
- **Gladiolus bulbs** - Plant in ceremonial rows, 10cm deep
- **Dahlia tubers** - Plant with crown just below soil surface

### ✂️ The Art of Sacred Pruning

- **Roses** - Remove dead wood and weak growth with clean, sharp secateurs. Shape for airflow and future blooms
- **Fruit Trees** - Thin excess blossoms on young citrus, guava, and fig trees to strengthen remaining fruit
- **Ornamental Shrubs** - Light pruning of spent winter growth on gardenias and jasmine
- **Herbs** - Pinch growing tips of basil to encourage bushy growth

### 🌿 Nourishment Rituals

Weekly feeding schedule:

- **Roses** - Apply balanced fertiliser and deep watering ceremonies
- **Fruit Trees** - Feed citrus with high-nitrogen fertiliser for spring flush
- **Vegetables** - Side-dress tomatoes and beans with compost and aged manure
- **Orchids** - Resume diluted liquid feeding as growth begins
- **Lawns** - Apply slow-release fertiliser to kikuyu and buffalo grass

### 🏡 Grounds Keeping Mysteries

Essential garden tasks:

- **Mulch Application** - Spread organic mulch around fruit trees and vegetable beds
- **Lawn Preparation** - Scarify and overseed thin areas in kikuyu lawns  
- **Hanging Basket Revival** - Replant winter baskets with trailing nasturtiums and petunias
- **Compost Activation** - Turn compost heaps and add green materials to awaken decomposition


## 🧘 Reflection from the Journals

> “Spring does not arrive all at once—it unfurls like a fern, slowly, deliberately, with each frond a promise.”  
> — *From the Field Notes of Custodian Kelpgrove*

Trust in the ancient rhythms. The soil remembers.
