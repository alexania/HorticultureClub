On a morning veiled in mist and mystery, Custodians Ferngrove and Zephyrmire ventured into the Derivco Greenbelt in pursuit of terrarium-worthy moss colonies. Though the skies were gentle and the humidity ideal, the expedition was met with an unexpected and most foul miasma—an emanation from the nearby sewage station, whose treated effluent had been released into the creek. The air was thick, the spirits... conflicted.

Undeterred, the Custodians pressed deeper into the greenbelt, guided by instinct and the promise of botanical communion.

## 🌱 Botanical Findings

**Mosses:**
- **Cushion Moss** (*Leucobryum* sp.): Found in the middle of the path, forming dense, pillow-like colonies ideal for terrarium cultivation.
- **Loose Moss** (possibly *Hypnum* sp.): Trailing along damp stones, with a feathery texture and vibrant green hue.

**Ferns:**
- **Boston Fern** (*Nephrolepis exaltata*): Thriving near the creek’s edge, fronds arching gracefully in the humidity.
- **Unidentified Large Fern:** Taller specimen with finely divided fronds—possibly *Blechnum tabulare* or a local *Cyathea* species.

**Flowering Plants:**
- **African Blood Lily** (*Scadoxus multiflorus*): Numerous specimens in bloom, their spherical red inflorescences glowing like botanical lanterns.
- **Thorny Lacefern-like Plant:** Likely *Asparagus falcatus*—notable for its underground runners and defensive spines.
- **Mimosa-like Tree:** Resembled *Mimosa pudica* but lacked nyctinastic movement; possibly *Albizia adianthifolia*.
- **Possible Bromeliad:** Rosette-forming plant with stiff, strap-like leaves—potentially *Aechmea* or *Tillandsia* genus.

## 🌺 Propagation Efforts

In addition to moss collection, the Custodians undertook a delicate propagation effort involving several juvenile specimens of *Scadoxus multiflorus* (African Blood Lily). Using improvised tools—namely plastic knives and fingernails—they carefully unearthed a few bulbs nestled beneath leaf litter and damp soil.

The bulbs, though small, displayed healthy root systems and vibrant coloration. Cuttings were also taken from nearby foliage for observational study and potential rooting trials. These specimens have since been transferred to the Society’s propagation chambers, where they will be monitored for growth and bloom viability.

## 🩸 Ceremonies Performed

### Botanical Bonding Rite
While navigating thorny terrain, both Custodians sustained minor finger injuries—thus forming an impromptu blood pact with the local flora. Though unintentional, this act has since been recognized by the Society as a valid form of “Botanical Bonding.” The ritual is now documented as a spontaneous offering of lifeforce to the Greenbelt.

### Humidity Meditation
At the creek’s edge—where the air hung heavy with mist and municipal undertones—the Custodians performed the traditional Humidity Meditation. Breathing deeply of the river-misted atmosphere (augmented, perhaps, by the local water treatment facility), they acknowledged the moisture that sustains all botanical life, regardless of provenance.

The ritual concluded with a whispered invocation to *Custodes Arcana Viridis*, offered with both reverence and a touch of gallows humor. It is now considered a rite of resilience, reminding members that even sacred humidity may come with a scent of civic infrastructure.

### Greenbelt Naming Ceremony
Upon discovering a particularly moss-rich alcove beneath a fig-root arch, the Custodians performed the Naming Ceremony—bestowing the site with the name **The Verdant Hollow of Zephyrgrove**. A wax-sealed scroll was buried beneath a stone cairn to mark the occasion.

## 🧪 Specimen Notes

- Moss samples were collected for propagation and terrarium installation.
- Observational sketches of ferns and lilies were added to the seasonal journal.
- Soil and humidity readings were taken for future reference.

## 🌗 Member Reflections

> “The moss was resilient, even in the shadow of the miasma. I believe it chose us. The blood pact was unintended—but perhaps necessary.”  
> — *Custodian Ferngrove, Keeper*

> “I saw the fern fronds bow slightly as we passed. Whether wind or welcome, I accepted it as a sign. The Greenbelt remembers.”  
> — *Custodian Zephyrmire, Keeper*

## 🌗 Closing Reflection

Though the expedition began under less-than-auspicious atmospheric conditions, the resilience of the Custodians—and the abundance of botanical life—transformed the outing into a fruitful communion with Durban’s greenbelt arcana. The mosses now reside in glass sanctuaries, thriving under watchful eyes.

> “Even amidst the miasma, the moss endures. So too must we.” — Custodian Zephyrmire
